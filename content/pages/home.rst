I am a post-doctoral researcher in astrophysics at the `Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris`_, working in the `BLACK`_ ERC project led by `Marta Volonteri`_. I just completed my PhD at the `Observatoire de Lyon`_ :abbr:`last summer (2016)` with Jérémy Blaizot.

I work on numerical simulations of high-redshift galaxies with the :abbr:`AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)` code RAMSES_. My main research interest is the formation and evolution of galaxiesat high redshift. During my thesis, I tried to model how the hydrogen-ionising radiation (λ ≤ 912 Å) emitted by massive stars in star-forming galaxies escapes into the inter-galactic medium. This is thought to be the mechanism responsible for the reionisation of the Universe that happened between *z* ~ 15 and *z* ~ 6 -- the *Epoch of Reionisation*.

Before that, I modeled the Lyman-α radiation emitted by gas infalling on giant galaxies to understand observations of so-called "Lyman-α blobs".

When I am not doing astrophysics, I share my free time between rock climbing, photography, science outreach and having fun with Python. I also enjoy discovering new cuisines and listening to almost any kind of music (sadly, I am really terrible at playing it…).
